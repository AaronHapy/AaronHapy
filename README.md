# Hey!

For the past 3 years, I've been a software engineer at Nagarro. In my spare time, I've been creating personal projects that help me improve my engineering skills. Lately, I have been interested in learning about AI and electrical engineering.

My most recent project focuses on creating an app similar to YouTube. The goal is to build something big and complex and, of course, become a better engineer.
